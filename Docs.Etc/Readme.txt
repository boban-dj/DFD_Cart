IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE EDITING PRODUCTS, AFTER INSTALLATION:
 When changing prices on existing items, if customers are currently online and done updating their order before you changed them, these price changes will not be reflected in their order (it will warn them if you delete it though). You may want to update currently existing item's prices when you least expect new orders to be coming in.

 
 Other human factors to keep an eye on:
 
1) Editing product lists cleanly and accurately

2) Installing the software on an internet server correctly

3) Spot check your recordkeeping for accuracy once in awhile, verifying your prices are accurate. If you have any offline records, you might want to spot check those as well. 

4) The internet server being properly configured and secured (internet crime has made more money than drugs as of 2005), preferrably having your php server set to globals=off at the very least...usually with a php.ini or .htaccess file. Consult your provider for how to tweak your server's setup. Check your current config by opening notepad on your computer, saving a new file as "info.php", and adding this text:
<?php phpinfo() ?>
Then upload the file to your server and view it in your web browser...you should see the php specs for your server.
